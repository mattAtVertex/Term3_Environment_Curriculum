<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>In this mile stone, we start the process of creating our capstone project. At this point, we have about six weeks to produce it. The advantage we have, though, is that we have run through term two with its in-depth and very specific scene… We’ve dive deeper into materials… We’ve dive deeper into level design… And we just completed a two week exercise in environment creation.</p>
<p>This week, you need to make sure that you have your concept in hand and approved by your mentor… and have started the block in of it.<br>Now, what does a successful capstone project consist of?</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s achievable</li>
<li>It’s relevant to the industry or the studio we want to work at… our North Star.</li>
<li>It’s engaging to us and to people who work in the industry or Studio that is our Northstar</li>
<li>It’s centered around a technical trend happening right now</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I consider to be the core four of a successful capstone project.&nbsp;So let’s talk about these in more depth to make sure that we’re clear.</p>
<h3>The Core Four</h3>
<p>What is <strong>Achievable</strong>? Number one, this means that you will be able to get it done within the specific time frame… I.e. six weeks. Of course, you probably figured that out. However, the important part of achievable is that you are thinking about and planning for the execution early. For example, this scene <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/gBmAe" target="_blank">here</a>by Peyton Varney is built from a very small modular kit that he built. When we look at it, it looks complex and like there’s a lot of detail. However the entire rafters was relatively few models that were simply rotated and moved so it didn’t look repetitive.</p>
<p>What's <strong>Relevant</strong>… What does that mean and how is that different from the other core four? Weel, relevant is our baseline. In many ways, I think of this as genre. If you wanna work at Naughty Dog, you probably don’t show up with a bunch of Disney environments. The genre is different. However, can you show up with some sci-fi environments?&nbsp; Again, relevant…</p>
<p>Relevant, in this case, means it is something that they are highly likely to pay you to do. In fact, they are probably paying somebody to do this right now. I want you to think of the people recruiting for this to be given strict instructions to find, for example, a type of troll you might see in lord of the ring… It can be that specific.</p>
<p>Make sure, that you have researched artists that work at your North Star and you are familiar with their work.</p>
<p>What does it mean for a project to be<strong> Engaging</strong>? How is this different from relevant? Well, the key baseline is that something is relevant… It is in the genre… It is an example of what the studio is doing now. However, we want to add a little extra spice to this. We want to communicate to the people that look in our portfolio that we love games, the craft, the storytelling aspects. This is where you get to differentiate yourself from just another mouse jockey. How can you tell the story or how can you add something that helps sell you as an important part of the team? Let me explain this a little further.</p>
<p>Michael Vladimirov created an amazing environment. You can find it <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/qQb3vP" target="_blank">here</a>. This environment includes many difficult aspects. It involves water. It involves 100 or so incandescent lamps creating all sorts of lighting opportunities and problems. It includes slimy fish that could be a material nightmare. The setting itself, a fish market, is ripe for all sorts of grime and dirt to showcase his material capacity and his ability to use decals.</p>
<p>What makes Michael’s environment so is engaging is the complexity. Of course, the variable is balancing this with achievability. However, this is also one of the important aspects of the job. You need to create something engaging to the user but also achievable within a specific time frame.</p>
<p>Finally, it should involve some important <strong>Technical Trend</strong>. What do I mean by this? Well, you may have heard me talk about my own past but I can summarize it here. I am in the position I am in today for one reason and one reason only. It’s not my sculpting skill. It’s not my 3-D skills. It’s because I got a job at Pixologic who swept through the industry with ZBrush and created an opportunity for me to meet artists around the world and advise those working at the most important studios in the world. This was a technical shift in the industry that I had no real part in setting in motion but was the beneficiary of.</p>
<p>What technical trend is going on now that you can be the beneficiary of? At this point in time one of the important trends is Unreal Engine. Specifically, though, it’s learning Unreal Engine to the point of almost being an Unreal Engine Generalist.</p>
<p>One of the great things in Michael’s portolio project, the fish market, is how he created fish animations using blueprints in Unreal.&nbsp; That showcases the depth of his knowledge with an unreal engine.</p>
<p>You can also look at Podcasts, YouTube channels, and Instagram channels that suddenly start to blow up. An example of this is William Faucher. Just by him focusing on Unreal Engine and creating awesome tutorials… He was able to catapult himself into a position as a leader in an emerging trend.<br>Now, this is a lot of talky talk. Ultimately the rubber hits the road with you. You need to find a piece that is meaningful to you and that you will work on even when you’re not motivated. However, you do need to be careful of one trap.</p>
<h3>The Trap Of Excellence</h3>
<p>Excellence is important. You have to operate at a super high level of quality to even be considered for a job. That is true. But has your quest for excellence veared into the shadow side of Perfectionism. Are you prioritizing what you think people will want to see over what you yourself want to make?</p>
<p>Of course, after all this telling you about what a successful project should have… I am now telling you to ignore that and focus on yourself… What are you supposed to do? Which way do you go?</p>
<p>In my mind, successful projects are those that are able to navigate the space between the things that excite us as individuals and those that resonate and connect with others. So, to answer the previous question, you don’t create just what the industry wants and you don’t create just what you want. You create something that is balanced between the two.</p>
<p>You create something that you connect with and something that you feel you can connect with the industry on.</p>
<p>I know this is a lot. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me. I have seen hundreds of students succeed and I’m here for you</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Decide on your capstone project!</p>
<p>Use the Core Four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achievable</li>
<li>Relevant</li>
<li>Engaging</li>
<li>Tech trend</li>
</ul>
<p>Balance between the two dichotomies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achievable vs Engaging</li>
<li>Relevant to you vs relevant to the industry</li>
</ul>
