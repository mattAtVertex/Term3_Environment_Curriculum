# Capstone Lesson Plan #2

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>In this mile stone we we continue on developing our capstone from the initial gray boxing. As our Capstone progresses through the week 7 to week 11, we have to allow for flex.</p>
<p>We’ve broken them up into relatively simple and common stages. However, your own Capstone will dictate what you focus on and the most important thing is to listen to your mentor. Trust your mentor and be strategic about how you develop your work.</p>
<h3>Your Focal Point</h3>
<p>What do I mean by, be strategic about how you develop your work? Well, one of the biggest problems that I’ve seen students have over the years is biting off more than they can chew. Their inner visionary is excited about getting into a project but has given zero thought to how they’re going to execute and whether or not they will be able to execute within their lifetime.</p>
<p>There’s an easy fix to this. The fix is to define a focal point.</p>
<p>For example, Imagine you have a church in an open field with mountains in the background and a fence in the foreground. What is the focus? In this case, the focus is the church and the surrounding areas. The mountain in the background is your relevant in the beginning stage. Maybe you’ll throw a simple landscape together to give it some presents but you’re not going to be focused too much on it. Instead, you’re gonna have your hands full developing the modular kit for the house, the trim sheets, the materials, modeling out all the extra pieces… And much more.</p>
<h3>Where We Start This Week</h3>
<p>Remember, there is flex and what I say may not apply 100% to you in your capstone. However, the most likely stage you’ll find yourself in is that you need to begin to model out your modular kit, and different elements of your environment. In the example of the church with the fence in the foreground… This week would have you focused on a modular fence, walls for the church, the steeple at the top, a porch if there is one… Basically, start building your assets.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In summary, It’s now time to create assets a.k.a. model them. However, you may have bitten off more than you can chew so make sure that you have prioritized one area of the concept to focus on. If you get that part done and modeled out then progress to a secondary focus and then to your final remaining area. Be strategic about how you approach the work</p>
