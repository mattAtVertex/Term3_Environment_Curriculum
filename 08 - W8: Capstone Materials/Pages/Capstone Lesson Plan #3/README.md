# Capstone Lesson Plan #3

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>In this mile stone, the focus is on creating the Material block in Again, leave room for flex in what is asked of you. Your Capstone and your mentor take priority over any specific assignment Vertex gives you.</p>
<p>Always remember that quality of execution is what counts here. If you need to alter or pivot your concept then now is a great time to do that. Always check with your mentor before doing that, though. You may see a mountain that to your mentor is a simple mole hill.</p>
<p>This stage is really about developing more assets to help you create your environment. Hopefully, you’ve done most of the 3-D modeling that you’ll need to do. Now, you’ll need to texture paint those materials. You’ll need to develop materials that might actually replace certain modeling tasks.</p>
<h3>Materials vs Modeling</h3>
<p>One of the biggest advances that substance designer made was in rendering certain modeling tasks and sculpting tasks obsolete. For example, wanna brick wall… We used to have to sculpt that back in the Flintstone era.</p>
<p>Now you just grab a material that somebody’s already made somewhere on the web or in Ssubstance Source throw it on and there you go. <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.artstation.com/jonathan_benainous" target="_blank">Jonathan BENAINOUS</a> is a great example of how Substance Designer can be used to replace complicated ornamental sculpting tasks. The work he’s done there is incredible.</p>
<p>Rocky terrain… Broken tile… Damaged concrete… These are all tasks that we used to have to do in programs like ZBrush but are now entirely done using materials.</p>
<h3>My Materials vs Megascans</h3>
<p>The question of whether not to use your own materials or Megascans' materials is not an easy one. I have heard tell of artists getting jobs primarily because they had great environment work but didn’t use their own materials and did everything from megascans. That was in Virtual Production, though, which puts a premium on more rapid development.</p>
<p>One of the key concepts I like to lead with is that learning the job is different than doing the job. Once you’re on the job, you have more freedom and more flexibility in terms of how you execute. When you are learning the job, you have to go through extra hoops to reassure employers that you are capable of doing XYZ… Even if you’re never actually the person to do it. Always remember that getting hired is a game and you’re playing that game… right now.</p>
<p>So, while it’s not easy to answer yes or no to Megascans materials it is easy to answer the question of whether or not you are showcasing your material ability or not. To that end, it’s recommended, as long as your mentor agrees, to be developing your own materials or at the very least creating your own variations using mixer.</p>
<h3>Skills Signals</h3>
<p>Ultimately it all comes down to this:</p>
<p><strong>What are the skill signals employers want to see and what are the skill signals you are capable of sending. </strong></p>
<p>What is the skill signal? In simple terms, it is something in your work that broadcasts a specific skill.</p>
<p>An example of a skill signal is <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/qQb3vP" target="_blank">Michael Vladimirov‘s</a> animated fish using blueprints. That sends a very clear message that Michael is comfortable in Unreal Engine and has a technical slant to his capacity.</p>
<p>Lighting is a very important skill signal. How you light your environment tells someone a lot about you. One thing it can tell others is how mature in your work process you are. For example, if you just have everything lit and you have point lights scattered throughout and the lighting looks like it’s difficult to control… You’re definitely more at the beginner stage. You haven't advanced to the level where lighting becomes part of storytelling. Instead, your focus may have been to quite simply “let there be light “.</p>
<p>Talk to your mentor about this idea of skill signals. It may very well be new to them. However, they’ll have experience with being able to make judgments about peoples work through different aspects within it. They may have direct experience reviewing peoples lighting work, for example.</p>
<h3>Skill Signals For Materials</h3>
<p>So what are the skill signals for materials? I’m sure a book could be written just about this and I am in no way shape or form suggesting that I understand or I’m aware of even 20% of this. It is ultimately your job to become the master here over your lifetime and come back and share that with us. What I can do, is make you aware of skill signals as an idea and as something that is happening every time artists review your work.</p>
<p>I can also, though, talk to you about a few skill signals I am aware of. I’ll list them out below and then chat a bit more.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Color saturation versus color brightness</li>
    <li>Roughness variation</li>
    <li>Micro detail</li>
    <li>Procedural verse layering</li>
    <li>Gradients and gravity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Color saturation versus color brightness</strong> is an important element to start with. It’s as simple a formula as the brighter something gets the less saturated it tends to be. The converse is also true. The darker something gets the more saturated it tends to be.</p>
<p>What’s most important isn’t that you’ve mastered color theory but that you’re just aware of these shifts and you are including them in your material in your texturing development. Avoid flat colors plastered on. Avoid colors with just simply value shifts to them where areas get darker and brighter. If you want to add depth to your material work, play with saturation levels as the object brightens or darkens.</p>
<p><strong>Roughness variation</strong>… I, personally, think of this as the most important. There’s nothing more obviously troubling than an object who has perfect CG specularity. It’s so easy to throw a grunge or to throw some sort of noise into a roughness channel that the absence of that causes me to question the artist‘s judgment. Obviously, not something you want to be happening in a hiring situation.</p>
<p><strong>Micro detail</strong> is the small break ups in a form. Tile is not 100% smooth. It’ll have small variations in its surface. I don’t mean tiny pitting on a molecular level. I mean the overall surface won’t be flat and instead will be slightly undulating. Every material is going to have a different characteristics surface and we humans are very aware of our surroundings. We can pick up the differences between plastics in leather quite easily and we also have judgments about cheap plastics versus genuine leather... So getting the proper micro detail is a big part of authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>Procedural versus layering</strong> is another important element like roughness variation. When I see a material with an obvious cloudy procedural dirt… It, also, makes me question the artist judgment. I wonder, can they not see how obvious it is? Why didn’t they just duplicate this layer three times, change the scale of each layer and blend the opacity between them, for example. Anytime you create noise on your model you want to start to layer that noise in and blend between layers that are at different scales. That’s how we replicate reality which operates at an infinite amount of scales.</p>
<p><strong>Gradients and gravity</strong> is another important conceptual item that’s based in our perception of the world. As we walk around our the room the bottom of the walls is usually darker than the middle. Peoples feet will be touching the trim, for example. A barrel that sits in a cellar will gather dust and dirt around its base while peoples hands may be rubbing the middle of it smooth and clean. Gradients are as much a law of our nature as gravity is a law of nature. Put it in. If you don’t… I’m gonna wonder who your teacher was… :-)</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Continue building the assets necessary to develop your environment. Texture you’re models. Build materials that perform some of the modeling for you. Make sure you showcase your skills and ask yourself what does my work broadcast to the viewer about you and about your skill.</p>
