# Capstone Lesson Plan #4

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>In this milestone, we want to work on the areas of our environment that can benefit from optimizations like trim sheets. Again, your Capstone may require some variations. However, we really want to be focused on optimizations and efficiencies at this point. How can we finish out our environment as quickly as possible…</p>
<p>Trim sheets, at the core, or an efficiency. They allow us to model and texture one thing… A portion of a brick wall or wood paneling… And then apply that all over our scene to finish out the material blockin.</p>
<h3>What Is A Material Block In?</h3>
<p>Just like how we block in the geometry of our scene, it’s also important that we are blocking in the materials in our scene. Some environment artist will also do what they call a color blocking pass.</p>
<p>Last week and this week or all part of you getting materials on every single part of your environment. Trim sheets have a special place in this equation.<br>Trim sheets have the capacity to replace geometry. I’ve heard of air conditioners being stored in a trim sheet and then placed on walls that are higher up and farther away from a user. Trim sheets could be parts of the sidewalk that needs to get filled out. Trim sheets could be used to establish the window seal and the wood framing around it.</p>
<h3>What We Want Done</h3>
<p>Ultimately, what we want done at this point is to have our models assembled in the environment and texture to the extent that they can be. Tileable materials added on top to continue to flush out the scene. We also wanna make sure that we are painting multiple tile lean materials using Vertex painting to blend between them. Then we want to create trim sheets that will help us add in all the other repetitive detail that doesn’t need to be geometry and can be more efficiently represented with things like trim sheets or atlases.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The goal is to finish the material blocking and get every surface covered with a material. To have all the gray replaced with Materials. You’ll continue to flush this out, though, throughout the rest of our work. These are, by no means, final materials.</p>
