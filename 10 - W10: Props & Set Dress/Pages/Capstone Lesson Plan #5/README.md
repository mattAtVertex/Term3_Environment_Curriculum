# Capstone Lesson Plan #5

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>In this milestone the goal is to litter. That’s right, your parents told you to never litter and to always clean up after yourself. Even Smoky The Bear told you about the hazards of throwing things out the window. Well, this week that all goes out the window.. along with Smoky The Bear! It’s time to make a mess.</p>
<p>The number two issue I see with students work, after lighting, is that their scene looks impossibly clean or it looks like that odd mix of dirty walls and dirty floors but no sign of the clutter and litter that would lead to it. So, your goal is to populate your scene with tens if not hundreds of small objects that might simulate the real world.</p>
<p>In fact, the goal this week is actually for you to look around at the world around you. Visit an environment like your scene… assuming it is safe to do so… and just examine all the stuff on the floor. Examine all the stuff that might be in the room. All the pieces of paper that may be laying about...</p>
<p>Make sure you check with your mentor but some of the set dressing that I’m talking about can quite easily be done using megascans. They have tons of decals that you can use as well to dirty up the textures. I always love to refer students to this video by Wikto Ohman's scene <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/3ok2mA" target="_blank">here.</a>&nbsp; It’s a great example of how even a simple scene like a bathroom can be made incredibly realistic and creepy with a dozen or so decals.</p>
<p>Of course, you may also have props that need to be built… that are a little bit more expensive than some thing you can get off of megascans… But this is the week to populate your scene with life and living. Don’t skimp. The real world is messy.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Ignore your parents. Make a mess... only in the CG environment though… If they ask you to clean your room IRL I will not assume responsibility for any resulting punishments… :-)</p>
