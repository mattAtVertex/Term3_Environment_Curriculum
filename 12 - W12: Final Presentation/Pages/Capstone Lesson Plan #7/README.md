# Capstone Lesson Plan #7

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>All right, you are in your last week. Congratulations!&nbsp; This week, go over your project with your mentor and ask them what is one thing that would dramatically improve the project.</p>
<p>There’s actually a great book called The One Thing that I follow religiously. The idea is that we often get buried underneath To Do lists, task management, family obligations, etc. There is always something that can take up our time.</p>
<p>However, there is also always One Thing that can make a significantly bigger impact than anything else on your list. What is that? Every day, I write down all the things I have to do for that day. I write them down on a sheet of paper because the act of writing seems to be more impactful. Then, I will find the one thing that if I do it… It sets me up for success better than anything else.</p>
<p>For example, today as I write this I have a lot of things to get done. Some of them are even arguably more important, in the short term, then writing this lesson plan. However, if I finish writing all of the lesson plans for term three then that sets up Vertex for all the other term threes and, arguably, has a greater impact for Vertex over the next nine months than anything else on my list.</p>
<p>As you have been building your environment you have been inundated with tasks. However, hopefully you’ve learned that some tasks are more important than others. You’ve also learned that the tasks you think are important aren’t necessarily the tasks that help you the most. For example, when you began this did you think that modeling and UV‘s were super, super, super important and had to be done first? Have you now learned that the most important thing is the texturing and the material… Or, maybe, you’ve learned that lighting is the most important thing and it can hide all manner of modeling and texturing sins…</p>
<p>So, now, find out the one thing that you can work on or focus on for the next week. Your final assignment is due a week from the start of this week.<br>Make sure to schedule your exit interview with Jean-Marc, as well.</p>
<p>If you need me, you know where to find me. Send me a message. I’m here for you.</p>
